                        Hello, my name is Mark Anthony Pascua. I am 24 years old and I currently reside in Irvine,
                        California.
                        I was born in San Bernardino, but moved to Orange County when I was just a baby. Once I was in
                        7th grade
                        my mom wanted a change so we moved to Hawaii and I lived there up until my senior year of high
                        school
                        and moved back to the OC. I graduated from Tustin High School and moved on to IVC. Throughout
                        the years
                        I
                        have constantly switched my major, moving from parttime to parttime job. I later figured out
                        that I
                        wanted
                        to major in buisness marketing with a minor in graphic design. I'm currently taking the coding
                        bootcamp
                        to
                        broaden my skill vocabulary so I can become more competative in my future job as well as picking
                        up
                        a job while I finish out school so I can get out of parttime work. I currently work two jobs as
                        a
                        Bartender
                        at one resturant and a Server at another. My interests include Video games, Dogs, Anime, Travel,
                        Fashion, Music, Dance,
                        and pop culture. I am a complete nerd once you get to know me. Through my time in college I
                        danced hip
                        hop in a collegiate dance team called Kaba Modern. I've made many friends and had a lot of
                        experiences
                        with my teammates, but proceeded to end my time there to focus on my future. I am excited to
                        push and
                        experience
                        more things in the future :).
